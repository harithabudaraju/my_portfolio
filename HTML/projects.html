            <h3>Project 1: Automated Traffic Light Control</h3>
            <p class="project-description">
              <b>Description:</b> This project implements an automated traffic
              light control system using Arduino. It simulates traffic flow and
              adjusts signal timings accordingly.In this project, 2 RGB LED's
              are used. one for pedestrains and one for vehicles.(3 LED's for
              vehicles and 2 for pedestrians can also be used). Based on the
              timings needed for each LED to glow,arduino programming code has
              been implemented on an online simulator and the results were
              achieved. The code can be used to simulate and test traffic light
              sequences for real-world intersections, helping to optimize
              traffic flow and reduce congestion.

            <h3>Project 2: Right scrolling marquee Message on CLCD</h3>
            <p class="project-description">
              <b>Description:</b> As soon as the Arduino board is setup, a
              static message starts scrolling from left to right..The process of
              implementing this project starts with initialising the CLCD using
              the command and data functions.. and writing the logic for
              displaying the characters on the CLCD. This type of codes can be
              applied for Information displays,Data visualisation,Eductional
              displays and creative projects.

            <h3>Project 3: TIMER seperator</h3>
            <p class="project-description">
              <b>Description:</b> In this project, 3 LED's are assigned to
              specific timers of the ATmega328P controller(TIMER 0,1,2). Each
              timers are programmed in such a way that all the 3 LED's start and
              stop at every 0.5 sec..(at the same time).. Timers are configured
              first and an ISR(Interrupt service Routine) function is called
              based on the requirement.This type of code is used in
              signalling,visual indicators like alarms. Concept of synchronizing
              actions using timers can be applied in various real-world
              scenarios to create synchronized and coordinated systems.

            <h3>Project 4: 10-Digit up-Counter and Down-counter</h3>
            <p class="project-description">
              <b>Description:</b> In this project,a 10 digit number "0000000000"
              is initialised and using the loop logic it is incremented to
              "9999999999" one number each at a time.. we can control the speed
              of the increment can be changed by introducing a delay..In down
              counter, action is opposite. The increment/decrement can be viewed
              on CLCD.This is used in Industrial Automation to track number of
              products produced or processed,sports count,Gaming devices to
              display the scores etc..

            <h3>Project 5: Industrial Machine State Monitoring System</h3>
            <p class="project-description">
              <b>Description:</b> In this project ,system is designed to monitor
              the state of a machine using three sensors: a temperature sensor,
              a humidity sensor, and a potentiometer. The data from these
              sensors is sent to the client, which can be a web browser, and
              also to the cloud using an ethernet shield. We used the picsimlab
              Arduino simulator, which has an ethernet shield, to send the data
              to the browser. The data is displayed on the local host IP address
              on port 80. Additionally, the sensor data is sent to Thingspeak
              cloud using a write API key. This allows us to view the data of
              the sensors on respective dashboards in order to monitor changes
              in the sensor data in real-time. The same data is also viewed on
              the serial monitor of the Arduino IDE. This provides a
              comprehensive and real-time view of the sensor data, allowing for
              effective monitoring and analysis. This system provides a robust
              and comprehensive solution for monitoring industrial machine
              states, allowing for real-time data viewing and analysis both
              locally and in the cloud.
